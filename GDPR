The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal data of individuals within the European Union (EU). It aims to give individuals more control over their personal data and to harmonize data protection laws across the EU.

Under the GDPR, personal data is any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person. This includes things like name, address, and IP address, as well as more sensitive information like racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and sexual orientation.

The GDPR applies to any organization, including companies and public authorities, that processes personal data of individuals within the EU. This means that if your organization collects or processes the personal data of EU residents, you must comply with the GDPR.

The GDPR sets out several principles for the processing of personal data, including that it must be done lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. Organizations must also only collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and must not process that data in a way that is incompatible with those purposes.

In addition to these principles, the GDPR also includes a number of rights for individuals in relation to their personal data. These include the right to be informed about how their personal data is being used, the right of access to their personal data, the right to rectification of any incorrect or incomplete data, and the right to erasure, also known as the "right to be forgotten."
