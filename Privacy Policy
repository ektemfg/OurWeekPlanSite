OurWeekPlan uses Firebase, Google Analytics, and Firebase Auth / Firebase Realtime Database to provide users with a seamless experience. This means that some of your personal data may be collected, used, and shared by these third-party services in accordance with their own privacy policies.

We may collect and use personal data such as your IP address, device information, and location data to provide and improve our services. This data is used for things like analyzing usage trends and diagnosing technical issues.

We may also collect and use personal data such as your email address and any other information you provide to us through in-app forms or other interactions with our app. This data is used for things like sending you updates and responding to your inquiries.

We may share your personal data with third parties, such as our service providers, in order to provide and improve our services. However, we will only share the minimum amount of data necessary and we require that these third parties protect your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.

We take the protection of your personal data seriously and we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data. However, no system is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal data.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or applicable laws. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your personal data.
